# IDM 221 Assignment: Preparation   
## Content Preparation
### Document Inspiration
1. Zara https://www.zara.com/us/
    - I like how the website strays from traditional clothing websites and I can take inspiration from it to make my site more original as opposed to standard.
    - As much as I like the uniqueness of the site, its current design is hard to navigate and as a website meant to sell clothes, the design complicates the process.
    - I would let the style of this site influence my own, but try to preserve its usability.
2. Bon Apetit https://www.bonappetit.com/
    - I really like how simple the website is while maintaining visual interest.
    - The website uses photos as the main attractions and I think this setup would work well for a portfolio website.
    - I'm inspired by the minimalistic approach the site takes when it comes to structure and set up while it maintains a trendy appearance that draws in users.
3. Matthew Park Art https://www.matthewparkart.com/
    - I found it interesting how the site uses a basic structure and personalized it to his own style.
    - The website is largely image based without feeling cluttered or overwhelming, something that I might try to achieve. 
    - One thing I wasn't a fan of was how the homepage lacked information and if I were to change it I would add something more personal to give my users insight into myself.
### Content Inventory
Hi! I’m Megan. I’m currently a second year student at Drexel University studying Interactive Digital Media. I’m originally from North Jersey and have lived there almost my whole life. As someone who values both academics and creativity, I found that Interactive Digital Media embodies both aspects and I’m eager to learn more about the field. 

While I don’t have much experience with coding yet, I have a background in design and have been taking art and design classes since middle school. I’ve coded small projects for classes like LED light cubes using arduinos but I feel that my skillset is centered more towards design at the moment. I look forward to expanding my knowledge on the subject and hope to become proficient on the topic.

When I’m not focused on school, I spend a lot of my time cooking and baking. Baking specifically has always been a hobby of mine. The lessons I learned through trial and error while first learning how to bake have carried into the way I think today. I like the idea that the work you put into what you make is a reflection of the final product and it’s gratifying to see my friends and family enjoy things that I put effort into.

Lots of my work experience has to do with customer service. As a sales associate I learned how to manage interactions with customers in order to improve their experience as well as create a more inviting and friendly store environment. Though dealing with dissatisfied customers was stressful at times, I managed to maintain balance between what’s good for the company as well as the customer. While communication is definitely not my best skill, these experiences have helped me strengthen them and gain more techniques when it comes to working with others.

Though I’m not set on the exact type of career I’d like, I know that it involves staying true to who I am. I know expectations from others may influence the way I work and design but I do not want it to overshadow my own style. As far as my career goes, it’s currently a work in progress, as many things are, but I would like to use my skills to help others grow and hopefully inspire others to do the same.
