<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
    Hi! I’m Megan. I’m currently a second year student at Drexel University studying Interactive Digital 
    Media. I’m originally from North Jersey and have lived there almost my whole life. As someone who 
    values both academics and creativity, I found that Interactive Digital Media embodies both aspects
     and I’m eager to learn more about the field.
   
    <br>While I don’t have much experience with coding yet, I have a background in design and have 
    been taking art and design classes since middle school. I’ve coded small projects for classes like 
    LED light cubes using arduinos but I feel that my skillset is centered more towards design at the 
    moment. I look forward to expanding my knowledge on the subject and hope to become proficient on 
    the topic.

    <br>When I’m not focused on school, I spend a lot of my time cooking and baking. Baking specifically has 
    always been a hobby of mine. The lessons I learned through trial and error while first learning how 
    to bake have carried into the way I think today. I like the idea that the work you put into what you 
    make is a reflection of the final product and it’s gratifying to see my friends and family enjoy 
    things that I put effort into.
   
    <br>Lots of my work experience has to do with customer service. As a sales associate I learned how to 
    manage interactions with customers in order to improve their experience as well as create a more 
    inviting and friendly store environment. Though dealing with dissatisfied customers was stressful 
    at times, I managed to maintain balance between what’s good for the company as well as the customer. 
    While communication is not my best skill, these experiences have helped me strengthen them and gain 
    more techniques when it comes to working with others.
    
    <br>Though I’m not set on the exact type of career I’d like, I know that it involves staying true to 
    who I am. I know expectations from others may influence the way I work and design but I do not want 
    it to overshadow my own style. As far as my career goes, it’s currently a work in progress, as many 
    things are, but I would like to use my skills to help others grow and hopefully inspire others to 
    do the same.
